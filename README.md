# Simon_Says
Small simon says prototype, this project is responsive, in other the objects on screen will adapt to the screen's resolution.

The game will generate a sequence of colors to push, with each correct input of the sequence the player will gain a point and a new color will be added to the sequence.

If the player fails to input the score correctly the game will end displaying the total score and game time.
